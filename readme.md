Completed:
1. Dynamically Added Matrix.
2. Implemented all task as mentioned in Applications.
3. Maintained coding standard & documentation when necessary.

Limitations:
1. UI Designed in a static way, with 3x3 matrix.
2. Took time to implement, traverse matrix diagonally. So manually traversing.(strict to 3x3 matrix)
3. Rarely Wild Character is not printing, sometimes printing more than once (UI Issue)
